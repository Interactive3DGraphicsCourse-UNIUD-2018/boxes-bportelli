Played around with textures. Tried to make a cube with a different texture on each face using CubeTexture, got a small skybox instead. Tried creating a Mesh with an array of materials as material, but Mesh was not rendered. Managed to make a "cube" with different textures on each face using 6 PlaneGeometry. Gave up on trying to apply different textures on the same mesh for the time being.

Decided on the subject of the scene. Made some sketches.
